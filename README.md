# CDS for Cucumber

Provides a library to write behaviour-driven tests for CAP applications.
It contains ready-to-use steps that help developers write tests in a BDD style.
The [cucumber](https://cucumber.io) project provides framework for that.
Currently the library supports SAP FioriÂ® Elements.

It would look like that:
```gherkin
Feature: Fiori preview page

  Scenario: Open first Fiori preview page
    Given we have started the CAP application
      And we have opened the url "/"
    When we click on first Fiori preview page
      And we search for "jane"
    Then we expect to have 1 table records
```

The project is in early **beta phase**, please expect changes.

## API

List of steps and details is available in the [API documentation](https://cap-js-community.github.io/cds-cucumber/list_namespace.html).

## Usage

Make sure you have a CAP project or create a new one with the following command,
which requires global installation of the [CAP development toolkit](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/jumpstart#setup): *npm i -g @sap/cds-dk*
```
npx cds init --add samples,sqlite && npx cds deploy --to sqlite
```

In addition the latest version of the **chrome browser** should be present on the system.

### Install

```
npm i -D @cap-js-community/cds-cucumber
```


### Configure

```
npx cds-add-cucumber
```

### Add feature files

File: test/features/first.feature
```gherkin
Feature: Fiori preview page

  Scenario: Open first Fiori preview page
    Given we have started the CAP application
      And we have opened the url "/"
    When we click on first Fiori preview page
      And we search for "jane"
    Then we expect to have 1 table records
```

For existing projects you have to adjust the example above.
